This repository contains a User API built on top of MongoDB, designed to be integrated into MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack projects or for other use cases. The API provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user data.

## Features
User Management: Perform CRUD operations on user data, including creating new users, fetching user details, updating user information, and deleting users.
Authentication: Secure endpoints with authentication to ensure only authorized users can access and modify user data.
Validation: Input data is validated to ensure integrity and consistency.
Scalable: Built on top of MongoDB, the API can handle a large number of users and is suitable for scaling up.

## Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed.
MongoDB server running.
